# today i learned

Collection of stuff I learn day to day. Things I have picked up on Hacker News, open-source, Twitter or day to day work. Inspired from [jbranchaud](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22908044).

I also keep collections of links I come across on [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/adhiraj/).
