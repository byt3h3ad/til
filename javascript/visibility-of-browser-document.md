# Be informed of when a browser document is visible

A browser's `visibilityState` property is an essential aspect of web development that plays a crucial role in optimizing user experience and resource management in web applications. This property is part of the [Page Visibility API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Page_Visibility_API), a web standard that provides developers with the ability to determine the current visibility state of a webpage.

The concept of visibility state revolves around whether a webpage is in a "visible" or "hidden" state. When a user navigates to a different tab, minimizes the browser window, or locks the screen, the webpage becomes "hidden". Conversely, when the webpage is in the foreground, and the user actively interacts with it, the state is "visible".
